This is the devlopment theme for the UWMC site redesign, based on the excellent Bones Starter Theme (http://themble.com/bones/) by Eddie Machado. All the styles are done in Sass (.scss files) and pre-compiled into CSS using CodeKit (http://incident57.com/codekit/).

All common style elements have been stripped out and placed in a single stylesheet: common.scss (http://uw-mc.org/xxx)
